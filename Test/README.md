#Lost in the Arts Center

##Theme

The website follows a theme of a submission page for the 30 minute film festival. I wanted to present the website so it seems that for festival you need to create a website to present the film. I see the 30 minutes film festival as some sort of a competition and I want the viewers to also feel like they are watching a competition submission. 

##How it was created

I used html for the initial design and the functionality of the page and used CSS to make the user experience better by making the website look more inviting. But I needed something to make the website stand out, so I used JavaScript to make the pictures and the title move so it creates some sort of a presentation to the viewer.

##Reflection

Initially I was thinking of another idea when I wanted to create the website. The initial wireframe had user going through links to get into other pages so they could in a way get lost in the website and find their way to the content. But what I realized was that I would be losing on the user experience if I went with this approach. So the next idea I came up with was to create some sort of a film submission website which also follows the theme of the 30 minutes film festival but doesn't lose on user experience. The goal was to make it easy and inviting for the user to see the movie which we made, and I think I succeeded in that.
