**Project Name: “Murder on the Menu”**

**-Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.**

Our project is an interactive comic that centers on mystery and investigation, where the player steps into the shoes of a detective solving a murder case in a retro American diner. Set in a 1950s-style restaurant, the player uncovers the story by finding clues and interacting with characters. The setting is key - a warm, nostalgic diner that contrasts sharply with the chilling murder, keeping the player on edge.
Thematically, we're aiming towards a vintage detective vibe, inspired by classic crime novels but with our own take. The goal isn’t just to tell a story but to immerse the player in an experience where they are the detective. You walk through the crime scene, look for small details, follow leads. The player is actively investigating, not just passively reading.
In terms of the experience we’re trying to create, it’s about that feeling of satisfaction when you put the pieces together yourself. We’ve designed the comic to slowly build tension, making the player feel the weight of their decisions as they get closer to figuring out what really happened.
We also wanted the aesthetic to play a big role in setting the tone. The vintage neon signs create a strong atmosphere that contrasts with the murder investigation. That way, it keeps the player visually engaged while they work through the clues. The setting isn’t just a backdrop - it’s part of the mystery, and we wanted the restaurant to almost feel like another character in the story.

**-Process: How did you go about implementing the concept? Describe your roles and what your contribution was.**

To bring our concept to life, we started with a brainstorming session where everyone contributed a range of ideas, focusing on how to make the detective experience interactive and engaging. The initial discussions revolved around the storyline—how the murder mystery would unfold, what kinds of clues the player would uncover, and how the plot could take different paths based on their choices. We wanted the investigation to feel organic, so we worked through various outcomes and scenario details, making sure each clue added depth and complexity to the story.
The decision to create the project as an illustrated comic came naturally when we realized that one of our team members is passionate about drawing. This enthusiasm led us to choose a visual approach that would allow us to tell the story in a dynamic way. The 1950s diner setting became the perfect backdrop - nostalgic and comforting on the surface.
On the interactive side, we drew inspiration from games like Her Story and Oxenfree, where players aren’t just following a script but actively piecing together clues to solve the mystery. Several members of the team took charge of the coding aspect, integrating interactive features that would allow players to investigate crime scenes, examine objects, and interact with characters. 
Throughout the process, collaboration was key. We worked closely to make sure the visual style and narrative were aligned, ensuring that the interactive elements felt intuitive and enhanced the storytelling. The illustrations weren’t just there to set the mood - they became integral to the experience, guiding the player’s investigation.
In the end, our project came together as a blend of storytelling, design, and gameplay. The combination of engaging visuals, a captivating narrative, and interactive mechanics created an immersive experience that allowed players to truly step into the role of a detective and enjoy the thrill of solving the case.

**-Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.**

Reflecting on the final version of our project, it is evident that we began with a solid, well-defined concept—a detective story set in a vintage American diner at night, with a focus on creating a mysterious and intriguing environment.
Our goal was to make the place feel alive, almost like a character in itself, using its vintage aesthetic and late-night ambiance to evoke a sense of intrigue and tension.
As we built the project, many of our initial expectations were met. The setting successfully conveyed the mystical atmosphere we envisioned, with retro design elements bringing the 1950s style to life. The clues were integrated in a way that encouraged players to explore and investigate, which was crucial to making the player feel like an active participant in the story.
We encountered some challenges along the way. One of the main hurdles was finding the right balance in the pacing of the mystery. We wanted to keep players engaged without making them feel overwhelmed. While we were able to maintain a sense of suspense, we realized that we needed to tweak some interactions and clues to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience for the players. This was a key area where our expectations changed as we worked on the project.
Overall, we believe the project met the core goals we set out to achieve. The atmosphere is immersive, the detective narrative is engaging, and the player is drawn into the investigation in a way that mirrors our original vision. Though there were adjustments along the way, the final version captures the feeling of being in a vintage diner wrapped in mystery, with every detail contributing to the unfolding story.
