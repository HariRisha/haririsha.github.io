# Project Name: How To Pretend To Be A Responsible Student

## Project Description
This project is a satirical short video guide that explores how students can pretend to have their lives together while secretly navigating the chaos of student life. The film uses playful language and humor to illustrate relatable moments of academic survival, taking inspiration from the funny difficulties and common problems of NYU Abu Dhabi students.

Through a three-step framework, the video illustrates:
1. **How to Look Fresh and Alert in the Morning**  
2. **How to Pretend You’re Studying in Class**  
3. **How to Survive a Last-Minute Crisis**  

The idea emphasizes the humorous side of these common problems while entertaining and connecting with audiences by combining realistic guidance with exaggerated scenarios. Our goal was to provide viewers a funny, relatable, and entertaining experience that highlights the less exciting parts of student life.

## Process

### Concept
Our common experiences as students of procrastination, stress, and performing under pressure inspired the concept. We wrote a script that had a relatable tone while hilariously exaggerating these situations. With a comedic undertone, the voiceover narration was intended to lead the viewer through each step.

### Pre-production
- **Scriptwriting:** Finalized the script with specific dialogues and actions for each scene.  
- **Shot List & Equipment:** Prepared a detailed shot list and secured the necessary equipment, including a BlackMagic Pocket Camera, various lenses, and tripods.  
- **Locations:** Chose shooting locations to represent dorm rooms and classrooms, common student environments.  

### Production
We filmed every shot with the concept in mind, making sure exaggerated facial expressions and comedic voiceover were key components. The filming process included a mix of wide, medium, and close-up shots to emphasize details like the hectic morning routine, distractions in class, and the chaotic last-minute study session.

### Post-Production
- Edited the video using **Adobe Premiere Pro**, adding transitions, comedic timing, speeding up the video, and dramatic sound effects.  
- Integrated the voiceover narration, aligning it with visual actions to maintain humor and clarity.  
- Completed the film by adding captions for convenience, color grading, and adjusting audio levels.  
- Designed the website to match the video’s theme using AI-generated images and a cohesive color palette. This created a seamless visual experience while ensuring functionality and aesthetics.

## Interactivity through the Website
The website was divided into three main parts:
1. **Morning Edition**  
2. **Classroom Edition**  
3. **Crisis Edition**  

### Features
- **Parallax Panels:** Each step was presented in parallax panels, adding depth and movement as users scroll.  
- **Interactive Activities:**  
   - In "Morning Edition," users check off tasks to prepare for class.  
   - In "Classroom Edition," users complete scenario-based tasks with immediate feedback.  
- **Final Panel:** Celebrates the user's progress, encouraging reflection and motivation.  
- **Navigation:** A sticky navigation bar allowed easy access to any section.

## Challenges Faced

### Maintaining Proper Focus
Manually adjusting the camera's focus, particularly during dynamic scenes, required precision and attention to avoid blurry shots.

### Stabilizing Shots Without a Tripod
Not all frames were shot using a tripod. Techniques like steady handheld shooting were used to maintain clarity, especially in scenes like the ringing alarm clock.

### Minimizing Background Noise
Recording voices and sounds in classrooms and dorms was challenging due to air conditioning noise. This was resolved by recording all audio separately with dedicated equipment.

## Reflection/Evaluation
Our primary goal was to create a relatable and entertaining portrayal of student life challenges for NYUAD students and beyond. We aimed for high production quality while blending humor with reality. Additionally, we sought to create an interactive experience that resonated with users.

### Improvements for Future Projects
- Use more sophisticated equipment, such as light softboxes, to enhance lighting and video quality.  
- Focus on refining shooting techniques and experimenting with more dynamic camera movements.  

The video and website capture the chaos, fun, and creativity that went into their development. More importantly, this experience has laid the groundwork for future projects, equipping us with new skills, stronger teamwork, and a deeper understanding of translating creative concepts into engaging outputs.
